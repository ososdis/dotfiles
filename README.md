Welcome, these are my personal configuration dotfiles for pretty much everything I use on my Unix system. The life of this party is probably the AwesomeWM config. In case you're here for that, please head over to [Awesome Config](https://github.com/Purhan/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/awesome)

To download the assistant script run the command:
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Purhan/dotfiles/master/assistant.sh
```
